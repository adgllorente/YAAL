# YAAL

Yet another "Appwsome" launcher for Smart TVs. YAAL offers an easy way to test applications on SmartTvs without installing them every time. You will only have to install YAAL and once launched it will be ready to add menus and submenus with pointers to your applications hosted on any place.

YAAL also has support for remote controllers, identificates different models of SmartTvs and has different interfaces depending on where it is displayed. For example, if you are displaying it on a SmartTV it behaves as a launcher but if you execute it in a PC browser you will see all administration options.
